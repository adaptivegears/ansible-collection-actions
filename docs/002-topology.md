# EP-002: Topology Metadata

## Summary
This enhancement proposal explores the fundamental need for topology awareness in modern infrastructure, addressing why systems need to understand their physical and logical location within the broader infrastructure landscape.

## Motivation
Infrastructure systems require awareness of their location and relationships within the broader ecosystem to enable:
- Intelligent resource allocation and failover
- Geographic data compliance and sovereignty
- Latency optimization for end users
- Cost-effective resource distribution
- Disaster recovery capabilities
- Load balancing across regions

The lack of topology awareness leads to:
- Suboptimal resource utilization
- Increased operational costs
- Compliance violations
- Poor user experience
- Reduced system resilience

### Goals
- Define why systems need topology awareness
- Identify key topology information requirements
- Establish topology relationship principles
- Support infrastructure decision-making processes
- Enable location-aware operations

### Non-Goals
- Defining specific topology implementations
- Prescribing particular geographic structures
- Detailing technical storage solutions
- Specifying naming conventions
- Creating topology management tools

## Proposal
Establish a standardized approach for topology metadata that includes:

1. Topology Hierarchy:
   - Two-level hierarchy (region/zone) for resource organization
   - Clear naming conventions for identifiers

2. Metadata Requirements:
   - Machine-readable format
   - Human-readable identifiers

3. Business Context:
   - Regulatory requirements
   - Service level objectives
   - Cost optimization zones
   - Market presence areas
   - Customer proximity needs

## Drawbacks
1. Increased complexity in infrastructure planning
2. Additional factors to consider in system design
3. Potential conflicts between different topology needs
4. Cost implications of topology-aware decisions
5. Added operational overhead
