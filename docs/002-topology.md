# EP-002: Topology Metadata

## Summary
This enhancement proposal explores the fundamental need for topology awareness in modern infrastructure, addressing why systems need to understand their physical and logical location within the broader infrastructure landscape.

## Motivation
Infrastructure systems require awareness of their location and relationships within the broader ecosystem to enable:
- Resource allocation and failover
- Load balancing and traffic routing
- Latency optimization
- Cost-effective resource distribution
- Disaster recovery capabilities

The lack of topology awareness leads to:
- Increased operational costs
- Reduced system resilience
- Compliance violations
- Poor user experience

### Goals
- Define why systems need topology awareness
- Enable location-aware operations

### Non-Goals
- Defining specific topology implementations
- Detailing technical storage solutions
- Creating topology management tools

## Proposal
Establish a standardized approach for topology metadata that includes:

1. Topology Hierarchy:
   - Two-level hierarchy (region/zone) for resource organization
   - Clear naming conventions for identifiers

2. Metadata Requirements:
   - Machine-readable format
   - Human-readable identifiers

3. Usage Patterns:
   - Resource placement decisions
   - Capacity planning
   - Disaster recovery planning
   - Cost allocation

## Drawbacks
1. Increased complexity in infrastructure planning
2. Additional factors to consider in system design
