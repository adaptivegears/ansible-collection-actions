# EP-001: Infrastructure Topology Metadata Standardization

## Summary
This enhancement proposal addresses the need for a standardized approach to managing and storing infrastructure topology metadata. It aims to establish consistent practices for identifying and organizing infrastructure resources across different regions and zones.

## Motivation
Organizations operating distributed infrastructure face challenges in maintaining consistent information about where resources are located and how they are organized. Without standardized topology metadata:
- Resource management becomes inconsistent across teams
- Automation tools lack reliable location context
- Disaster recovery planning is complicated
- Compliance reporting becomes more difficult
- Infrastructure scaling decisions lack proper context

### Goals
- Define a standard format for expressing infrastructure topology
- Enable automated validation of topology information
- Provide a consistent way to store and retrieve topology metadata
- Support infrastructure automation and orchestration needs
- Facilitate clear communication about resource locations
- Enable topology-aware decision making

### Non-Goals
- Defining specific geographic locations for regions/zones
- Implementing cloud provider-specific topology requirements
- Creating a topology discovery system
- Managing network topology
- Handling application-level topology concerns

## Proposal
Establish a standardized approach for topology metadata that includes:

1. Topology Hierarchy:
   - Two-level hierarchy (region/zone) for resource organization
   - Clear naming conventions for identifiers
   - Validation rules for topology information

2. Metadata Requirements:
   - Machine-readable format
   - Human-readable identifiers
   - Consistent accessibility
   - Version control compatibility
   - Automation-friendly structure

3. Usage Patterns:
   - Resource placement decisions
   - Capacity planning
   - Disaster recovery planning
   - Compliance documentation
   - Cost allocation

## Drawbacks
1. May require changes to existing infrastructure documentation
2. Additional overhead in maintaining topology information
3. Potential conflicts with cloud provider-specific conventions
4. May not accommodate all organizational structures
5. Added complexity in infrastructure management processes
